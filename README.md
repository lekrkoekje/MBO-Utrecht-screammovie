# Scream 7 - Website Remake

> A school project focused on recreating the official *Scream Movie* website using modern web development practices.

## Overview
This project is part of an assignment for our education program, created by two students working together.  
Our goal is to redesign and rebuild the Scream 7 website with clean code, a structured layout, and responsive design.

The website is built using:
- **HTML** for the structure

- **Images & assets** based on the original website  
- **A small amount of JavaScript** for interactive elements  

## Features
- Modern, responsive page layout  
- Fully recreated navigation bar  
- Custom styling inspired by the original website  
- Organized project structure (HTML, CSS, JS, images)  
- Lightweight and fast  
- Compatible with all major browsers
